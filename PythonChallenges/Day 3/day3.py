 #Guess The Number

#Write a programme where the computer randomly generates a number between 0 and 20. 
#The user needs to guess what the number is. If the user guesses wrong, 
#tell them their guess is either too high, or too low. 
#This will get you started with the random library if you haven't already used it.
